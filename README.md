# Spam_Detection_Project
 Spam Detection Model using Machine Learning Classifies SMS messages as ham (legitimate) or spam (unwanted) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB). Includes text preprocessing, vectorization, model training, and evaluation with a confusion matrix visualization.

# 📊 Spam Detection Model

This is a machine learning project for detecting spam messages using the Naive Bayes algorithm.

## 🚀 Features
- Text preprocessing (removing stopwords, punctuation, etc.)
- TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction
- Naive Bayes classification
- Model evaluation with accuracy and confusion matrix

## 🛠️ Libraries Used
- Pandas
- Numpy
- NLTK
- Sklearn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used is `spam.csv` containing spam and ham messages.

## 📊 Model Accuracy
- Accuracy: **~96.5%**
- Visualized with a confusion matrix.

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Try different models like Logistic Regression or Random Forest.
- Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit.
